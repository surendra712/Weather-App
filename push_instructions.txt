## Instructions to Push Your Code to GitHub

Since direct authentication through the command line might be challenging, here are step-by-step instructions to push your code to GitHub:

### Option 1: Using Git with Personal Access Token

1. **Create a Personal Access Token (PAT) on GitHub**:
   - Go to GitHub.com and log in
   - Click on your profile picture in the top right corner
   - Go to Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Tokens (classic)
   - Click "Generate new token" and select "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Give it a name like "Weather App Push"
   - Select the "repo" scope to allow access to your repositories
   - Click "Generate token"
   - **IMPORTANT**: Copy the token immediately as you won't be able to see it again

2. **Use the token to push your code**:
   ```
   git remote set-url origin https://[YOUR_USERNAME]:[YOUR_TOKEN]@github.com/surendra712/Weather-App.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   Replace [YOUR_USERNAME] with your GitHub username and [YOUR_TOKEN] with the token you generated.

### Option 2: Using GitHub Desktop (Easiest Method)

1. Download and install GitHub Desktop from https://desktop.github.com/
2. Open GitHub Desktop and sign in with your GitHub account
3. Add your local repository (File > Add local repository)
4. Select the folder: d:/Projects/weather-notification
5. Publish the repository to GitHub

### Option 3: Manual Upload on GitHub.com

1. Go to https://github.com/surendra712/Weather-App
2. Click on "Add file" > "Upload files"
3. Drag and drop all your HTML files and README.md
4. Add a commit message
5. Click "Commit changes"

Your files are already committed locally, so any of these methods will work to get them on GitHub.
